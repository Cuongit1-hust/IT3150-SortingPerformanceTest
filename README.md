Program Description
This program is designed to test and compare the execution times of three sorting algorithms: 
Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Quick Sort. It allows users to measure the performance of individual 
sorting algorithms or compare all three simultaneously, using large datasets.

Features
1. Measure Execution Time of a Single Algorithm
*** Import a .txt file containing more than 10,000 elements.
*** Specify the number of elements to sort.
*** Select one of three sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, or Quick Sort).
*** Display the execution time of the chosen algorithm and save the results to a specified output file.

2. Compare Execution Times of All Three Algorithms
*** Select a pre-defined dataset size: 10,000, 100,000, or 1,000,000 elements.
*** Automatically load the corresponding input file.
*** Measure and display the execution times of all three algorithms.
*** Verify the accuracy of the sorted results and save them to an output file if all algorithms produce identical outputs.

3. Exit Program
*** The program allows users to exit gracefully at any point.
